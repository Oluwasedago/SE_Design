# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting
significant technical decisions made during the development of the
Industrial Signal Platform.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of architecturally
significant choices. Future maintainers can understand not just WHAT was
built, but WHY.
